I have developed this app as a request from Incloud Engineering GmbH to evaluate my skills for an internship as a web developer.

As for the Stack used here, I have used the MEAN stack technologies:
A MongoDB database, Loopback which is an ExpressJS framework and uses the Swagger API, Angular 6 for the frontend and NodeJS for the server side.

If I had a little bit more time I could have developed this application with the backend framework Laravel as we have already used it in a school project. But my choice quickly went for the NodeJS framework because it's so fast, easily integrated into an app, makes real-time web applications a real pleasure without forgetting the big and nice community behind it.

I would have also loved to learn and work with ReactJS on this project as it became a must have skill nowadays, but lack of time I have chosen to use the most familiar frontend framework to me which is Angular. 

It took me 4 days to finish the development of this project, working every night about 3 to 4 hours.

I'm overall happy with the resulting app and what I have achieved in a short time, I've tried to fix all the bugs which I have encountered, so I could deliver the perfect app. And I have learned so many things while working on this project.

As for the improvements and maybe upcoming features, I think we could have added some stats/achievements to boost creativity, sharing stats/achievements with friends, notifications, a pomodoro mode, possibility to remove and edit existing tasks and why not a mobile app or a browser extension.

What I liked and didn't like about this project : 

[✓] I really appreciated the freedom you gave me to choose the stack which suits me the best.
[✓] I also liked the idea of the project, as I'm using this kind of app in my dailylife.

[X] The only thing missing in the assignment specifications book was the last deadline for the deposit of the app. (I hope I'm not late).

Looking forward to hear from you, and join your team for bigger projects.

Sincerely,
